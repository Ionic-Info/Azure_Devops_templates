# Terraform docker GitHub Actions

To make the files available for other github actions we have to store them in `.github/workflows/` folder,
[terraform-docker.yaml](../.github/workflows/terraform-docker.yaml).

In [terraform.yaml](terraform.yaml) you can find a example how to use the action.

The action supplies the **plan validate and apply** stages.
